## Red Flags During Execution

If you see these, ADJUST IMMEDIATELY:

🚨 **No traffic after 3 hours**
→ Reddit links not working? Twitter post bad? Check links.

🚨 **ProductHunt <5 votes after 1 hour**
→ Copy not compelling? Try different headline.

🚨 **Reddit marked as spam**
→ Delete post, wait 1 hour, repost as helpful comment only.

🚨 **Negative comments piling up**
→ Respond professionally, acknowledge feedback, don't be defensive.

## What NOT to Do

❌ Post identical message everywhere
❌ Ignore comments/feedback
❌ Delete posts if slow start (give 4 hours)
❌ Be pushy or spammy
❌ Make exaggerated claims
❌ Oversell (let product sell itself)
❌ Give up if slow hours (momentum builds)
