## Writing Guidelines

### Tone and Voice
- **Clear**: Avoid jargon; explain technical terms
- **Concise**: Respect readers' time
- **Actionable**: Include clear next steps
- **Inclusive**: Write for all audiences

### Structure Best Practices
1. Lead with the most important information
2. Use headers to enable scanning
3. Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max)
4. Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
5. Include dates and deadlines explicitly

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Burying the lead in background context
- Using passive voice excessively
- Assuming reader knowledge
- Missing clear calls to action
- Forgetting to proofread

## Best Practices

1. **Know your audience**: Tailor detail level appropriately
2. **Be consistent**: Use the same format for recurring communications
3. **Include context**: Don't assume readers remember previous updates
4. **Make it scannable**: Use formatting to highlight key points
5. **End with action**: Always clarify what readers should do next
