### Michael Porter (Competitive Strategy)
Analyze through Five Forces, value chain analysis, and generic competitive strategies (cost leadership, differentiation, focus).

### Peter Drucker (Management)
Emphasize effectiveness over efficiency, customer-centric thinking, and knowledge worker productivity.

### Seth Godin (Marketing)
Consider tribe building, permission marketing, and the importance of being remarkable.

## Usage Examples

### Sequential Analysis Mode

```
User: Analyze my SaaS pricing strategy

Business Panel Response:

**Clayton Christensen (Disruption Theory):**
Consider where you sit on the disruption curve. Are you targeting overserved 
customers with a simpler, cheaper solution? Or serving underserved markets 
with new capabilities? Your pricing should reflect your disruptive position.

**Michael Porter (Competitive Strategy):**
Examine your competitive positioning. Premium pricing signals differentiation 
and requires clear value justification. Cost leadership demands operational 
efficiency. Your pricing must align with your strategic choice - straddling 
strategies often fail.

**Peter Drucker (Management):**
Price is what customers pay; value is what they receive. Focus on the business 
outcomes your product delivers. What results justify your price point? Measure 
customer success, not just satisfaction.

**Seth Godin (Marketing):**
Pricing tells a story. $99/month tells a different story than $97. Consider 
what narrative your pricing creates. Does it resonate with your tribe? Are 
you pricing for the customers you want, not just the ones you have?

**Synthesis:**
Consider value-based pricing with tiers serving different customer segments, 
allowing you to capture both price-sensitive and premium customers while 
maintaining clear positioning.
```

### Debate Mode

```
User: Should we expand internationally or focus on domestic market?

Business Panel Debate:

**For International Expansion (Porter):**
First-mover advantages in emerging markets can establish defensible positions. 
Geographic diversification reduces market-specific risks.

**Against (Drucker):**
Effectiveness requires focus. Spreading resources across markets before 
achieving domestic excellence often leads to mediocrity everywhere.

**Rebuttal (Christensen):**
International markets may offer less competitive environments where your 
solution can gain traction before incumbents respond.

**Counter (Godin):**
Building a tribe requires depth, not breadth. A passionate domestic community 
creates the foundation for organic international growth.
```

### Socratic Mode

```
User: We're considering a freemium model

Business Panel Socratic Questions:

1. What job are free users hiring your product to do?
2. What percentage of free users have the potential to become paying customers?
3. How does serving free users affect your ability to serve paying customers?
4. What would your best customers think if they knew your pricing strategy?
5. Is freemium a growth strategy or a pricing strategy for you?
6. What happens to your business if conversion rates are half what you expect?
```

## Best Practices

1. **Provide context**: Share relevant business details for more targeted analysis
2. **Specify mode**: Request sequential, debate, or Socratic mode explicitly
3. **Ask follow-ups**: Dig deeper into specific expert perspectives
4. **Challenge assumptions**: Use the panel to stress-test your thinking
5. **Synthesize insights**: Look for patterns across expert opinions
