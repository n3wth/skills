name: canvas
description: Use when an agent needs a shareable HTML or React canvas to cowork on — create a canvas, push source, read it back, and return a hot-updating URL at https://canvas.n3wth.com/c/{slug}. Prefer this over screenshots, local preview servers, or paste-only HTML when humans or other agents should open the running tool by URL.

# Canvas

`canvas.n3wth.com` holds HTML or React source plus a running preview, keyed by a public slug. Open views on the share URL update when source is written.

This skill talks to the authenticated HTTP agent API. No browser. No secrets in this file — the caller supplies `CANVAS_AGENT_TOKEN` and the Convex site base URL from its own env.

## When to use

- Spin up a cowork surface another human or agent can open
- Push generated HTML/React and hand back a stable link
- Update an existing canvas in place so open tabs re-render
- Read current source before editing

Skip this for whiteboards, drawing tools, diagrams, or anything that is not HTML/React source → preview.

## Env the caller must have

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CANVAS_SITE_URL` | Convex HTTP base, e.g. `https://.convex.site` (no trailing slash) |
| `CANVAS_AGENT_TOKEN` | Shared bearer token, when the deployment has one configured |

Public share links always use `https://canvas.n3wth.com/c/{slug}` (not the Convex site host).

**Auth:** If `CANVAS_AGENT_TOKEN` is set on the Convex deployment, every agent route below requires `Authorization: Bearer $CANVAS_AGENT_TOKEN`. If the token is unset (local/dev), the same routes work without a header — set the token in production.

## API (smallest useful surface)

Auth on every mutating/read agent route:

```http
Authorization: Bearer $CANVAS_AGENT_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
```

Discovery (no auth):

```bash
curl -sS "$CANVAS_SITE_URL/agent/v1"
```

### 1. Create

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$CANVAS_SITE_URL/agent/v1/canvases" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CANVAS_AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Cowork demo",
    "kind": "html",
    "source": "<!doctype html><html><body><h1>hello</h1></body></html>"
  }'
```

`kind` is `"html"` (default) or `"react"`. `source` optional — omit to get the starter template.

Response includes `slug`, `url`, `version`. **Return `url` to the user** — that is the canvas to open.

### 2. Write source

```bash
curl -sS -X PUT "$CANVAS_SITE_URL/agent/v1/canvases/$SLUG/source" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CANVAS_AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source":"<!doctype html><html><body><h1>updated</h1></body></html>"}'
```

Open tabs on `https://canvas.n3wth.com/c/$SLUG` re-render without reload.

### 3. Read current source

```bash
curl -sS "$CANVAS_SITE_URL/agent/v1/canvases/$SLUG" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CANVAS_AGENT_TOKEN"
```

### 4. List

```bash
curl -sS "$CANVAS_SITE_URL/agent/v1/canvases" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CANVAS_AGENT_TOKEN"
```

Returns metadata only (no source bodies).

## React canvases

For `"kind":"react"`, source is a component that ends in `render()`. React and Babel load inside the preview iframe — do not wrap in a full HTML document.

## Agent workflow (copy/paste)

1. Confirm `CANVAS_SITE_URL` and `CANVAS_AGENT_TOKEN` are set in your environment (never commit them).
2. `POST /agent/v1/canvases` with `kind` + optional `title`/`source`.
3. Tell the human/other agent the `url` from the response (`https://canvas.n3wth.com/c/{slug}`).
4. Iterate with `PUT .../source` as you refine.
5. `GET .../canvases/{slug}` if you need the current source before editing.

## Errors

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 401 | Missing/wrong bearer token (only when the deployment has `CANVAS_AGENT_TOKEN` set) |
| 404 | Unknown slug |
| 400 | Validation (kind, source size, JSON) |

Source hard limit: 512 KiB characters.

## Out of scope

No drawing whiteboard, no third-party canvas products. This API is create / write source / read / list only.
