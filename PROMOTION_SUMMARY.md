❌ Don't deviate from daily checklist (follow it religiously)
❌ Don't send emails all at once (batch them by day)
❌ Don't skip engaging with comments (respond within 1 hour)
❌ Don't wait for perfect analytics (track real-time, adjust quickly)
❌ Don't burn out (pace yourself, this is Week 1 of many)
❌ Don't ignore negative feedback (respond thoughtfully)
❌ Don't oversell (focus on value, not promotion)
❌ Don't create new content (use what's provided)
❌ Don't skip awesome lists (they drive quality traffic)
❌ Don't forget to have fun (enjoy the launch!)

## BONUS: Week 2 Planning

While Week 1 is running, start thinking about:
- Which platforms drove the most traffic? (focus there Week 2)
- Which skills got the most interest? (promote those)
- Which influencers responded? (build relationships)
- What questions came up repeatedly? (address in content)
- What worked better than expected? (double down)
- What fell flat? (don't repeat Week 2)

All of this becomes your Week 2 strategy.
