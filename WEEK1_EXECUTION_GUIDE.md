## HANDLING COMMON QUESTIONS

### "Why offline? Doesn't everything need to be cloud now?"

Great question! We're big believers that not everything needs to be cloud. Skills are markdown files - zero API dependency means:
- No costs
- No rate limits
- No tracking
- Works even with local models
- Faster execution
- You own all your data

Cloud is better for discovery (our website), but offline is better for privacy and reliability.
```

### "What about [competitor]?"
```
We love what [competitor] is doing. We see ourselves as complementary/different because:
[specific differentiators]

Worth trying both and seeing what fits your workflow. We're here if you want to switch!
```

### "How do I create a skill?"
```
Great question! Skills are just markdown files. Full guide here:
- [Link to CONTRIBUTING.md]
- [Link to skill example]
- [Link to skill-creator skill]

Much easier than you might think. We're actively looking for contributions!
```

### "Will this work with [other tool]?"
```
Currently supporting Claude Code and Gemini CLI. We're actively working on support for:
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Copilot
- [Other tools mentioned]

If you have a specific tool in mind, let us know! GitHub issues or discussions are the best place to request this.
```

### "How do I report a bug/issue?"
```
Thanks for finding that! Please report it here:
https://github.com/n3wth/newth-skills/issues

Include:
- Skill name
- What you expected
- What actually happened
- Your setup (OS, tool version, etc.)

We respond to issues within 24 hours usually.
```
