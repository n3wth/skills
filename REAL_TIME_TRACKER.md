## What to Do If Metrics Are Offline

### Traffic Below Targets

**If <200 visitors by hour 3**:
- Increase Reddit posts (2x frequency)
- Check if links are working
- Verify GA4 tracking
- Post HackerNews immediately
- Send email Wave 2 early

**If <500 visitors by EOD**:
- ProductHunt not tracking well → focus on Reddit
- Reddit posts underperforming → improve copy
- Email response low → try different subject lines
- Next day: Double Twitter posts, increase Reddit

### Engagement Below Targets

**If Reddit upvotes <50 by hour 2**:
- Post is off-topic or spammy → delete and repost
- Wrong subreddit → post to r/ChatGPT instead
- Poor timing → wait for peak hours

**If ProductHunt votes <10 by hour 1**:
- Page not loading properly → fix
- Copy not compelling → revise headline
- Product not launching → verify status

**If Twitter impressions <50**:
- Not enough followers yet → tag relevant accounts
- Wrong hashtags → use trending tags
- Wrong time → post during peak hours

## Critical Metrics Formula

### Conversion Rate Calculation
```
Visitor → Install Rate = (Install Clicks ÷ Visitors) × 100
```
**Goal**: >5% = 50 installs per 1000 visitors

### Cost Per Acquisition (if paid)
```
CPA = Total Spent ÷ Confirmed Installs
```
**Goal**: <$0.50 per install

### Traffic Attribution
```
Traffic ÷ Total = % of total traffic
```
**Watch for**: Single channel >50% (too risky)

### Engagement Rate
```
(Likes + Comments) ÷ Reach × 100 = Engagement %
```
**Goal**: >3-5% for social

3. What to double down on
4. What to kill

React fast. Adjust faster.
